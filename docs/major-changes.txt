I made some additions to Milestone 2 (my additions are to scope clarity, but doesn't increase scope)

Milestone 2: SQL and Python drag-and-drop UIs implemented (front-end only)

Success Criteria:
Repository access is shared and able to be pulled and built to prove functionality.
All operators appear in a categorized, scrollable palette with clear icons and labels as detailed in requirements.
Dragging and dropping operators is smooth and consistent (≤100ms lag).
Operators snap precisely to valid grid locations, visually confirm attachment points, and maintain layout integrity.
Connections between operators behave accurately (cannot overlap, float, or disconnect unintentionally).
Containers, formatting, and alignment rules are consistent across SQL and Python builder screens.
No flicker, jitter, or duplicate rendering issues.
All drag-and-drop actions must include visual feedback (hover state, shadow, highlight) to communicate state to the user.
All interactive behaviors must be tested on multiple devices (iOS + Android) to confirm cross-platform consistency.
UI and transitions must be production-quality and demo-ready with all core user paths validated end-to-end.
Code conforms to formatting standards (i.e. SQL best practices, pep8) as the user builds it by using an AST
The current state of the code that the user has built is available at all times in the client-side
An API is mocked in; hardcoded to return a single result dataset or Python compilation
Python code visualization is able to be played via flexible components to handle API response
All buttons are operable; undo, redo, reset, run (calls to mocked API)
Out of Scope: 
Server-side code execution, data persistence


1. Not sure what the question is; not sure what "Create a canvas means" - I am definitely supportive of simplicity! 2. The empty box is a symbol to indicate to the user the position of a required argument (for example, the "MAX()" function requires an argument inside of MAX())
3. I'm not sure what the question here is, but I hear that there are performance concerns. I don't have specific suggestions for optimization (I'd need a specific performance issue to look at to offer performance-tuning advice.) The drag-and-drop code editor is the core functionality of the app. There will be many tiles on the screen at once. 4. Good question - I think for SQL, automatic formatting is easy and makes sense. For Python, it doesn't make sure. The user should be able to indent/dedent lines
